# ScholarlyXtract

## Overview
Our information retreival system performs ranked retreival on a dataset that contains data relating to many scientific papers during the 20th century, including the authors, title, body, bibliography, along with sample queries and their relevance scores.
For checkpoint 2 we have implemented our ranked retrevial algorithm and the associated evaluation

## Setup & Run

### Setup
Have specific imports need to be able to interact with our data and perform specific functions
The following need to be installed in python
- `pip install re`
- `pip install ir_datasets`

### Run
- To run `python ScholarlyXtract.py`
- From there will be greeted with simple UI, type `e` to get NDCG for system
     - Do not have a general query working yet (saving for UI checkpoint)
- A NDCG score will be presented
